### Split Building Limits Boilerplate

Included in this project is some boilerplate code to get started on the programming task. You may of course alter any of the boilerplate code to fit your solution.

`samples` 

Includes [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) sample inputs for the building limits and height plateaus.


`Program.cs`

Includes methods to read GeoJSON from a local file, deserialize to a [NetTopologySuite](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite) feature collection
and extract the relevant geometries.

Be sure to update the file path constants before running the program.

`SplitBuildingLimitsClass.cs`

This is where you are expected to work from!
